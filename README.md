# Botnet Detection System

## Overview
This Python script provides a simple botnet detection system that analyzes network traffic to identify potential botnet activity. It includes both a signature-based detection mechanism and the ability to generate random network traffic for testing purposes.

## Features
- Signature-based detection: Detects botnet traffic based on predefined signatures.
- Protocol analysis: Focuses on TCP packets to improve efficiency and accuracy.
- Random traffic generation: Generates random network traffic for testing the detection mechanism.
- Sniffing network traffic: Captures and analyzes network packets using Scapy.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Scapy

## Usage
1. Ensure Python 3.x and Scapy are installed on your system.
2. Run the script `botnet_detection.py`.
3. View the output to see if any botnet activity is detected.

## Configuration
- You can modify the botnet signatures list in the script to include additional signatures as needed.
- Adjust the number of packets generated for testing by changing the parameter in the `generate_network_traffic` function.

## Acknowledgments
- This script was created for educational purposes to demonstrate botnet detection techniques.
- Special thanks to the Scapy development team for providing the powerful network packet manipulation capabilities.

# WHOEVER FORKED THIS PROJECT AND FORKED MY TEMPLATE I HAD SCRRATCHED UP 2 MONTHS AGO - YOU INSPIRED ME TO MAKE IT BETTER - THANK YOU <3 - I HOPE YOU FIND THIS AGAIN AND FIND IT WAY WAAY MORE USEFUL AND PROFESSIONAL <3

# FEEL FREE TO CONTRIBUTE OR FORK. IF YOU FIND THIS INTERESTING LEAVE ME A * SO I CAN GET FAMOUS AND MAYBE NO LONGER HAVE TO FRY FISH IN MY DRYER FOR DINNER :D
